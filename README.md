# Voxels-v2-E2
A Garry's Mod Expression 2 chip that allows you to place and mine blocks.

Within the e2 is a config section where you can turn on the abbility to unfreeze your builds while keeping them in tact,
it gets a bit laggy though so its off by default.

The controls are pasted into chat when the e2 is placed down.
